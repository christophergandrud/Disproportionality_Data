<a id="what-is-it" class="anchor" href="#what-is-it" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is it?</h2>

<p>This is a <strong>.csv</strong> formatted data set of the Least Squares Index of electoral disproportionality for 121 countries between 1945 and 2011. The Least Squares Index is also commonly referred to as the Gallagher Index. The data set combines Michael Gallagher's recently updated data (<a href="http://www.tcd.ie/Political_Science/staff/michael_gallagher/ElSystems/Docts/ElectionIndices.pdf">here</a>) with some holes (see below) filled in with data made available by John Carey and Simon Hix (<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Ejcarey/Data_Archive.html">here</a>).</p>

<h2>
<a id="why-did-i-make-this" class="anchor" href="#why-did-i-make-this" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why did I make this?</h2>

<p>There is currently no complete and recently updated Gallagher Index data freely available in a format that is easy to do statistical analysis on. The data on Michael Gallagher's <a href="http://www.tcd.ie/Political_Science/staff/michael_gallagher/ElSystems/Docts/ElectionIndices.pdf">website</a> has been recently updated (the one I used was from 21 February 2012). However it is only available in PDF format; not exactly the easiest format to merge into an R or Stata file.</p>

<p>So, after going through the somewhat painstaking work of entering all of this data into a .csv file (and filling in some holes with Carey and Hix's data) I decided to make my efforts publicly available. Hopefully, this will free up some research time for more productive endeavours than copying and pasting data from a PDF file.</p>

<p>To import the file directly into <strong>R</strong> simply use the <code>source_data</code> function:</p>

<p>The Least Squares or Gallagher Index of electoral disproportionality basically uses the standard least squares method for comparing the relationship between two samples. It compares parties' votes to the legislative seats they are given. Higher numbers on the Gallagher Index indicate that there is a greater disparity between votes and seats, i.e. elections have produced more disproportional outcomes. A Gallagher score of 0 would indicated that the election produced perfectly proportional outcomes.</p>

<p>These notes give specific details about how I combined the two data sets into the one .csv file.</p>

<p>Data is for national overall disproportionality.</p>

<p>I did not include Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Turkish Cyprus, or Palestine.</p>
